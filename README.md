# <Password-Generator>

## Description

I created this password generator in order to create a randomly generated, secure password for a user. I also wanted to make sure it could include common requirements for passwords on websites to make it more accessible for more users. This makes it much easier than having to come up with it by yourself! I learned the importance of taking a step away from your code every once in a while. If you feel stuck or need to make revisions, it helps to have a fresh mind and fresh eyes on your code. I also learned functions and if statements aren't as daunting as they seem! Once I understood the logic behind it, everything became much simpler.


## Usage

To use the password generator simply click "Generate Password"! You'll then be prompted with a query for password length between the value of 8 and 128. Then 3 confirm prompts for whether or not to include uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters in your password. After that, your password will be generated!

I used this website to help with the randomNumber variables throughout the code (lines 35-103):

I used this website to apply the substring method to my if statements (ex line 32):
